## AI Powered Request Handler System - Architecture Diagram

This document provides a high-level overview of the architecture for the AI Powered Request Handler System MVP. It illustrates the key components, their relationships, and the flow of data within the system.

### 1. System Components

The system consists of the following main components:

- **API:** A FastAPI-based RESTful API that handles user requests, performs basic input validation, and interacts with the request service.
- **Request Service:** A Python service responsible for processing user requests, translating them into appropriate OpenAI API calls, handling responses from OpenAI, and formatting them into user-friendly outputs.
- **Database:** A PostgreSQL database used to store user data, requests, and responses.
- **Caching:** A Redis-based caching layer for storing frequently accessed data, improving performance and reducing API call frequency.

### 2. Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates the flow of data within the system:

    subgraph User
        User((User))
    end
    subgraph API
        API((API))
    end
    subgraph Request Service
        RequestService((Request Service))
    end
    subgraph OpenAI
        OpenAI((OpenAI API))
    end
    subgraph Database
        Database((PostgreSQL))
    end
    subgraph Caching
        Caching((Redis))
    end
    
    User --> API
    API --> RequestService
    RequestService --> OpenAI
    OpenAI --> RequestService
    RequestService --> Database
    RequestService --> Caching
    RequestService --> API
    API --> User
```

### 3. Key Interactions

- **User-API:** Users interact with the system through API endpoints (e.g., POST `/requests`).
- **API-Request Service:** The API receives requests from users, validates them, and passes them to the request service for processing.
- **Request Service-OpenAI API:** The request service translates user requests into OpenAI API calls, sends them to the OpenAI API, and receives responses.
- **Request Service-Database:** The request service stores request data and responses in the PostgreSQL database.
- **Request Service-Caching:** The request service utilizes Redis caching for frequently used requests to improve performance.
- **Request Service-API:** The request service returns processed responses to the API, which then delivers them to the user.

### 4. Architectural Patterns

- **Layered Architecture:** The system follows a layered architecture, with different components handling specific functionalities.
- **Microservices (Potential for Future Expansion):**  The system is designed with the potential for future expansion into a microservices architecture for improved scalability and maintainability.

### 5. Key Design Considerations

- **Scalability:** The system is designed with scalability in mind, using technologies like PostgreSQL and Redis that can handle increasing data volumes and request rates.
- **Performance:**  Caching and optimization techniques are used to ensure fast and efficient response times.
- **Security:** Robust input validation, secure API key management, and proper authentication mechanisms are implemented to protect the system and user data.

This architectural diagram provides a clear understanding of the AI Powered Request Handler System's design. The system's modular structure, efficient data flow, and focus on scalability, performance, and security provide a solid foundation for a successful MVP.
