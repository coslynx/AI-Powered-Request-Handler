## AI Powered Request Handler System - API Specification

This document outlines the API specifications for the AI Powered Request Handler System, defining endpoints, parameters, responses, and expected behavior for interacting with the system.

### 1.  API Endpoints

#### 1.1  POST `/requests`

- **Description:** Handles user requests to the OpenAI API, processing requests, interacting with the OpenAI service, and returning responses.

- **Request Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "text": "Your request text"
  }
  ```

  - **`text` (string):**  The user's request text to be processed by the OpenAI API.

- **Response Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "response": "The OpenAI response"
  }
  ```

  - **`response` (string):** The formatted response from the OpenAI API, including the generated text, code, or other output.

- **Status Codes:**

  - **201 Created:** The request was successfully processed and a response has been generated.
  - **400 Bad Request:** The request body is missing, invalid, or malformed.
  - **500 Internal Server Error:**  An unexpected error occurred during request processing.

#### 1.2  GET `/requests/{request_id}`

- **Description:** Retrieves details of a specific request, including the request text, response, and timestamps.

- **URL Parameters:**

  - **`request_id` (integer):**  The unique identifier of the request to retrieve.

- **Response Body:**

  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "user_id": 1,
    "text": "Your request text",
    "response": "The OpenAI response",
    "created_at": "2023-10-26T12:34:56.789Z",
    "updated_at": "2023-10-26T12:34:56.789Z"
  }
  ```

  - **`id` (integer):**  The unique identifier of the request.
  - **`user_id` (integer):**  The ID of the user who submitted the request.
  - **`text` (string):** The user's request text.
  - **`response` (string):**  The OpenAI API response.
  - **`created_at` (ISO 8601 timestamp):** Timestamp of the request's creation.
  - **`updated_at` (ISO 8601 timestamp):** Timestamp of the last update to the request.

- **Status Codes:**

  - **200 OK:**  The request was successfully retrieved.
  - **404 Not Found:**  The specified request ID was not found.

### 2.  API Security and Authentication

- **Authentication:**  The API currently uses JWT authentication (optional for the MVP).

- **Authorization:**  Users can be authorized based on roles or permissions to access specific API endpoints.

- **Input Validation:** All requests are validated using Pydantic to prevent common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

- **Error Handling:**  Error messages are returned to the user with appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 500 Internal Server Error).

- **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse.

### 3.  API Performance and Caching

- **Caching:**  The system utilizes Redis caching to improve performance and reduce the frequency of calls to the OpenAI API for frequently used requests.

### 4.  API Documentation

- This API specification is maintained in `docs/api_specification.md`.
- For more detailed developer information, refer to the developer guide: `docs/developer_guide.md`.

### 5.  API Versioning

- The current API version is `v1`.  New versions will be introduced with appropriate versioning in the URL paths (e.g., `/api/v2/requests`).

### 6.  CORS Considerations

- The API supports CORS to allow requests from different origins.

### 7.  Middleware

- The API uses JWT authentication middleware (optional).
- Implement any additional middleware as needed for logging, error handling, or other functionalities.

### 8.  Integration with Other Components

- The API interacts with:
  - The request service (`api/src/services/request_service.py`) for processing user requests.
  - The database (`api/src/models/request_model.py`) for storing requests and responses.
  - The caching layer (Redis) for caching API responses.

### 9.  Testing

- This API specification is tested thoroughly to ensure correctness, security, and performance.

### 10.  Future Improvements

- Implement a user-friendly web interface for submitting requests.
- Add support for additional OpenAI models and features.
- Enhance caching strategies to improve performance.
- Implement more granular authorization controls.

This API specification provides a comprehensive overview of the AI Powered Request Handler System's API endpoints, functionality, security measures, and performance considerations.  The documentation is designed to be clear, concise, and helpful for developers who are integrating with this API.
