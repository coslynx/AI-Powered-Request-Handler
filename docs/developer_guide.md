# AI Powered Request Handler System - Developer Guide

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers working on the AI Powered Request Handler System. It outlines the project's core functionality, technical architecture, and key considerations for development, testing, and deployment.

### 1. Project Overview

The AI Powered Request Handler System aims to streamline user interactions with OpenAI's powerful language models. This Python backend API simplifies the process of sending requests to OpenAI and receiving comprehensive, tailored responses. The system caters to the growing demand for seamless AI integration, empowering developers and users alike with cutting-edge AI capabilities.

### 2. Architecture Overview

The system consists of the following key components:

- **API:** A FastAPI-based RESTful API that handles user requests, validates input, and interacts with the request service.
- **Request Service:**  A service responsible for processing user requests, translating them into appropriate OpenAI API calls, handling responses from OpenAI, and formatting them into user-friendly outputs.
- **Database:**  A PostgreSQL database used to store user data, requests, and responses.
- **Caching:**  A Redis-based caching layer for storing frequently accessed data, improving performance and reducing API call frequency.

**Data Flow:**

1. Users submit requests through API endpoints.
2. The API validates the request and passes it to the request service.
3. The request service processes the request, interacts with the OpenAI API, and caches responses.
4. The request service returns the formatted response to the API.
5. The API returns the response to the user.

### 3. Technical Details

**Technology Stack:**

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Web Framework:** FastAPI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
- **Authentication:**  JWT with PyJWT
- **Caching:**  Redis
- **Containerization:**  Docker
- **Deployment:** Docker Compose

**Database Design:**

- The database schema includes tables for users, requests, and responses.
- Relationships are defined between tables to maintain data integrity.
- Indexes are used to optimize database queries.

**API Design:**

- The API uses a RESTful architecture, adhering to standard HTTP methods for CRUD operations.
- API endpoints are designed to be clear, well-documented, and versioned.
- Request and response payloads are defined using Pydantic data models for validation and serialization.

### 4. Development Guidelines

**Coding Style:**

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code formatting.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Maintain consistent indentation and spacing.

**Error Handling:**

- Implement try-catch blocks for handling potential exceptions.
- Log errors using appropriate log levels.
- Return meaningful error messages to users.

**Logging:**

- Use Python's `logging` module for logging information.
- Log errors, warnings, and informational messages as needed.
- Avoid logging sensitive data.

**Testing:**

- Write unit tests for individual functions and methods.
- Write integration tests to test interactions between components.
- Use mocking to isolate dependencies during testing.

**Deployment:**

- Use Docker for containerization, providing a consistent environment across development, testing, and production.
- Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container deployments.

### 5. API Documentation

**API Endpoints:**

- **POST `/requests`:**  Handles user requests.
    - **Request Body:**
        ```json
        {
            "text": "Your request text"
        }
        ```
    - **Response Body:**
        ```json
        {
            "response": "The OpenAI response"
        }
        ```

**Error Handling:**

- The API returns HTTP status codes to indicate success or error conditions.
- Common error codes include:
    - **400 Bad Request:**  Invalid request format.
    - **401 Unauthorized:**  Missing or invalid authentication token.
    - **500 Internal Server Error:**  Server-side error during request processing.

**Authentication:**

- The API uses JWT tokens for stateless authentication.
- Users must provide a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header to access protected endpoints.

### 6. Deployment Guide

**Prerequisites:**

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL

**Steps:**

1. **Build the Docker Image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t ai-request-handler:latest .
    ```
2. **Deploy using Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

**Environment Variables:**

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`:  Your OpenAI API key.
- `DATABASE_URL`:  Connection string for your PostgreSQL database.
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`:  Secret key for JWT token generation.

### 7. Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

- **OpenAI API Errors:**  Check your OpenAI API key and ensure sufficient rate limits.
- **Database Connection Errors:**  Verify your database connection string and check database logs for errors.
- **Authentication Issues:**  Ensure users provide a valid JWT token and check token expiration times.

**Debugging Tips:**

- Use logging to track the execution flow and identify potential errors.
- Use debugging tools (e.g., pdb, VS Code debugger) to step through code and inspect variables.

### 8. Future Plans

- **Expand API Functionality:**  Add support for more OpenAI models and features.
- **Implement Real-time Features:**  Add real-time data updates using websockets.
- **Improve Performance:**  Optimize caching strategies and database queries.
- **Enhance Security:**  Implement advanced authentication and authorization mechanisms.
